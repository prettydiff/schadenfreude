## Notes

* I am not formatting the data response, because I don't know what your data looks like.  The data comes back in a function called *ajax*.
* Enjoy random background images that stretch to fit the view port by creating a directory named *images* and putting 11 images in there named: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.  Finally uncomment line 974 in the interaction.js file.

Enjoy!
